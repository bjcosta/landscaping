# Asthetics

The concept of what I am trying to achieve of creating a beautiful landscape using edibles already has a name and is commonly called Foodscaping or Edible Landscaping. 

It is becoming much more popular as people see that edibles can be used to create beautiful landscapes. Also I have seen an increase in public foodscapes at places like our local botanical gardens.



# Approach

The approach I am taking with this project is to get the larger structure of the garden including positioning of main trees, pond, retaining wall, sitting locations etc working from a functional design perspective first but ensuring there is some measure of balance in those first. I then hope to be able to use hardscaping material choice, lower storey plant selection including some ornamentals and flowers in addition to edibles to create the asthetic I am looking for.

I am also trying to use the [Artistic landscape design components](#artistic-landscape-design-components) defined below to evaluate existing gardens I like to understand what it is about them that makes them stand out to me so I can try and recreate similar things in my own design.


One thing I have noticed In looking at existing gardens, is that there are many non-edible landscape designs that are really well defined and look amazing. However the majority of the productive landscapes make a number of trade-offs on the asthetics to achieve productivity. Either that or they all seem to like the open cottage garden style almost exclusively.

Some common differences I have seen in existing foodscaping include:
* Most asthetically designed edible landscapes are very open with few trees and mostly consist of smaller plants
* Many of the asthetically designed edible landscapes make use of lots of variegated annuals
* Edible landscapes often appear much less dense

I have seen a few examples of nice looking edible landscapes that contain a few trees, with similarites to what I want to achieve, but most of them still appear more open than I would like. The other difficulty is many videos of edible landscapes show minute detail on the individual plants in the landscape, and few of them zoom out and show the overall design and flow. This also happens with lots of unique and great little ideas, but there seems to be less of a focus on the larger picture and asthetic design like we see in more ornamental gardens. This is making getting references to base my design off difficult.


# Style choice

# Inspiring Gardens

**Small Urban Edible Forest (Edible)**

I like this, it has elements that are similar to our design with trees near edges and openess down the middle, some ground cover and a small pond. The lower canopy is very open compared to what I want to do though. I would prefer to layer down slowly from the trees on the edge to the ground covers providing something that looks much more dense and less open.

**Linda Vater Garden Tour (Decorative)**

This style is fantastic and I would love to try and achieve something akin to this style in our landscape. I am not certain it will be possible. One idea I would like to try is use the fruit/nut trees in the upper storey and then place edibles where possible, and where insufficient sun shaded out place decorative plants to fill in the gaps.

I like the balance achieved in this garden with the larger trees, shrubs near the boundary fences hiding them, the seating places is a focus area and destination in the scene.

**Ideas for creating an amazing edible garden (Edible)**

I like aspects of this, however is more dense and less open I think than what we plan to do. I like the pond. The bees are a focus in this design and I think the trees are bigger than we can have on the boundary.

**The Plummery (Edible)**

This is a *tiny* block. It is very densly packed using lots of vertical space. I like this style though. They are using more annuals and garden beds than we plan to though.

**Agriscape (Edible)**

This looks like a company doing edible landscape designs in America

Actually theses looks very similar to what we have planned in the openess, plants on boundaries.

**Permaculture Garden (Edible)**

This isn't as clean looking as the others but a nice garden still. I am wondering if ours will look more like this. I would like to try and use artistic design to make it more like the agriscape versions.

**Justin Rhodes Urban Garden (Edible)**

This is also similar to what we have available IMO, except that I have tried to add the plants to the boundaries and open the middle space. This adds many more plants in the middle area.

# Artistic landscape design components

To help me in the artistic/asthetic design of the garden, I have been finding it helpful to read instructional websites describing the components of artistic design and how they apply to landscaping. One great source for me has been The Spruce. It describes landscape design as [The Spruce](<https://www.thespruce.com/aesthetic-definition-in-landscape-design-2130999>):

> Landscape design is concerned both with aesthetic and functional elements of landscaping. While the former is ultimately subjective (there is no accounting for tastes, as the old expression goes), professional landscape designers are, in fact, guided by some basic rules that help them to create aesthetically pleasing designs in their clients' yards.
> 
> Where landscape design is concerned with aesthetics, the terminology used is somewhat similar to that employed in the art world: Landscape design principles include such subjects as color theory, form and texture, the role of focal points, and how our perception of "line" and "scale" influence our opinion of a scene.

From that I am hopeful that, my non artistic brain can learn a little bit of what is required to make a landscape asthetically pleasing and design something I like in my yard.

Following is my summary of what I have learned on artistic landscaping design, all information I ave read tends to define similar concepts (some have extra, others give slightly different names). The two key categories of concepts I have seen are often described when it comes to landscape design include:
* Design Principles : These are higher level aspects of the design we are striving to achieve like is the design balanced, or does it have unity
* Design Elements : These are specific technologies/design-tools used to achieve the principles, like the design-element of colour; if I have a bright red bush on one side, do I want to achieve balance (principle) by adding similar colour to the other side of the garden

I am not going to go into these in a lot of detail, as others describe it much better than I can. But this list is helpful for me to evaluate my design against each point and then consider what design elements I can incorperate to help improve the design to say be more unified.

I am not going to write too much detail as you ccan read it elsewhere all ove the internet. I will however list some of the design principles and elements I have seen mentioned multiple times on different websites. I did like the descriptions at:
* [Principles of landscape design](<https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/principles_of_landscape_design>)
* [Landscape Design for Beginners](<https://www.thespruce.com/landscape-design-for-beginners-2130815>)
* [Guide to Landscape Design](<https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-landscape-design-2131075>)
* [Landscape Design for Beginners, How to Use Unity, Balance, Color and Texture](<https://youtu.be/yYjYBR7TdhI>)
* [Landscape & Garden Design Principles](<https://youtu.be/6w3YG8Zo9Nw>)


## Design Principles

**Unity**

A definition of [Unity](<https://www.thespruce.com/aesthetic-definition-in-landscape-design-2130999>):

> Unity, or "harmony," has been achieved when the viewer senses that all the landscape plants in a garden design complement each other and have been chosen with one over-arching theme in mind.

**Balance**

A definition of [Balance](<https://richardstbs.com/8-basic-principles-of-landscape-design/>):

> Balance is simply a sense of equality. There are two types of balance in design: symmetrical and asymmetrical balance. In symmetrical balance, two sides of the landscape are identical while in asymmetrical balance, the landscape composition is balanced using different elements and objects which have almost similar imaginary weight.

**Focalization**

A definition of [Focalization](<https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/principles_of_landscape_design>):

> Focalization is sometimes referred to as focalization of interest or simply focal point. The focal point is the strongest element in the design in any given view. 


**Simplicity**

A definition of [Simplicity](<https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/principles_of_landscape_design>):

> Keeping landscapes simple, not cluttered or fussy is always a good practice. This is not the opposite of complexity. Landscapes that make people happy and comfortable avoid using too many colors, shapes, curves and textures, but in no way does this mean simplistic, boring or lack of imagination.


## Design Elements

Some design elements or tools to impact the priciples include:

* [Colour](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDq8Kw3WwS8>)
* Texture
* Form
* Line
* Rhythm
* Proportion


# Questions to ask in design

So based on the above key aspects of landscape design, I will use a number of questions to help be understand and evaluate my design.

TODO: Need to do this
* What is consistent and blends in
* What varies a lot
* What are the hard lines in the design and where are they leading me to
* Where is the majority of the defined form, is the form consistent for different elements or different
* What do we want the focal point to be
* Where do the lines and other things direct me to go
* What are the transitions between zones

I can probably evaluate this for each of the "zones" in my design:
* Sitting area
* Hidden shaded path
* Pond
* Grassy area
* Kitchen window


Some things to consider:
* Bridge for shade, needs some focal point to identify where it is going to (special sitting rock)
* When sitting at the table, what is the viewfocus (The ond is difficult to see)
