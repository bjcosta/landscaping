# Pond Design

TODO: This page is very much a work in progress. I am just outlining things at the moment and have a lot of filling in to do


Designing and building a pond is a huge amount of work compared to other parts of a backyard transformation. I have now watched hundreds of tutorials, examples and read numerous blocks of information about building and designing ponds and still dont feel I know enough. I will try and keep here a ordered reference of information I have looked at and summarize what I see are the major aspects of pond design that I have considered.

Over time I expect I will add many different sub-pages to this document.

# Big question to answer early (Pond position)

I have narrowed down to two main design options that have a big impact on the structure of the overall backyard. It is about where to place the retaining wall and pond. This decision needs to be made early, can't be changed later and has a big impact on everything else.

I may also need more iterations on this when I get feedback about regulations from my local council about any requirements.

These regulations will be different everywhere, but where I live in NSW Australia, I need to find out if a pond deeper than 300 mm is considered a pool and will require a fence. In which case I dont think a pond is feasible to put into my design (well not one that is incapable of sustaining a small ecosystem with fish and not just a bowl full of algae). 

NSW Pool regulations define a pool according to: https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/building-and-renovating/pools-and-pool-safety/swimming-pools-and-spas

> The law applies to any excavation, structure or vessel including swimming pools and spa pools that are:
> 
> * capable of being filled with water to a depth greater than 30cm, and
> * used, designed, manufactured or adapted for swimming, wading, paddling or any other human aquatic activity.

There are however many extra documents since the original definition changing different aspects of pool and fencing regulations, I didn't see any changes in the definition of swimming pool. Also I spoke with a Duty Planner from Wollongong Council and they said yes we will need a DA as it is deeper than 300 mm, but they also confirmed that it is not classified as a pool and thus will not require boundary fencing. The DA will need to outline this information.
https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/building-and-renovating/pools-and-pool-safety/pool-fencing-requirements


This document is very clear, though is it current and official? It looks to be so: https://www.swimmingpoolregister.nsw.gov.au/inspection/Inspection%20Page%20FAQ.pdf

> **Question:**  Do I need to fence (install a childresistance barrier for) my fish pond?
> 
> **Answer:** No. If a fish pond has been designed and, manufactured to be solely used as a fish pond, then no child-resistant barrier is required.


Another useful bit of information, is I think I will need a DA to approve a pond deeper than 300 mm. According to this document which defines "Exempt and Complying Development Codes": https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/EPI/2008/572/part2/div1/subDiv40


> (1)  The standards specified for that development are that the development must—
>      (a)  not have a water depth of more than 300mm, and
>      (a1)  not have a surface area of more than 10m2, and
>      (b)  if it is constructed or installed in a heritage conservation area or a draft heritage conservation area—be located in the rear yard.
> (2)  Despite subclause 1(a), a pond sump may be placed in a water feature or pond below a water depth of 300mm if the sump is covered with a bolted or anchored grate that is capable of supporting a weight of 150kg.

I believe this means if the pond was < 300 mm deep and surface area < 10 m ^2 then no approval is required. 

One other reference about pond fencing and depth requirements is not official but helpful (and helped me locate the FAQ with a clear answer is): https://ozponds.com/do-ponds-need-a-fence/

With that said, I plan to address the safety aspect of the pond in the design as well though position selection, bottom contour and planting choices.

The two designs I am looking at are below. 

## Pond near house
![../history/stage_5/topdown.png](../history/stage_5/topdown.png)

* 8.5 m^2 area, 1.7 m ^ 3 (Straight 70cm walls is 4 m ^3) volume, 12 m perimeter (Can probably extend length a bit but not width)
+ Positive: Has access to full sun
+ Positive: Is visible from the kitchen
+ Positive: Looks good for larger deck build
+ Positive: Little or no impact by run-off from chickens
+ Positive: Retaining wall very low height around pond better for structural support
+ Positive: No issues with pool fence regulations
+ Positive: Extra retaining for the pond itself should be unnecessary
- Negative: Smaller pond (A little narrower)
- Negative: Difficult to control shading (naturally or artificially)
	* I may be able to use a small over pond bridge to create some shade (and a cool path to thinking rock on other side of pond)
	* I can probably work something out here with planting shrubs on north/west edge
- Negative: More difficult plumbing of the hydrostatic release drain (Needs to pipe further under grass down to pool retaining wall)
- Negative: Less space available for planting trees

## Pond near back of property
![../history/stage_6/topdown.png](../history/stage_6/topdown.png)

* 9.3 m^2 area, 2 m ^ 3 (Straight 70cm walls is 5 m ^3) volume, 12 m perimeter
+ Positive: My wife prefers this one
+ Positive: Larger pond
+ Positive: Easy to control shading (naturally or artificially)
+ Positive: More space available for planting trees
+ Positive: Simpler plumbing of the hydrostatic release drain
+ Positive: Simple to plumb future radial flow filter if desired
+ Positive: Maybe able to work some kind of fencing into design if necessary but will still be ugly
- Negative: No access to full sun there is forced part shading
- Negative: Not visible from the kitchen
- Negative: Blocks access back of property/glasshouse
- Negative: Looks cramped if we do larger deck extension one day
- Negative: Potentially impacted by run-off water from chickens unless suitable drainage is sufficent
- Negative: Nearer to steep section of retaining wall may have issues with structural support
- Negative: Maybe issues with pool fence regulations
- Negative: May need extra retaining for pond itself as land still sloped there without significant retaiing wall above

# Overview of pond styles

There are a few major pond building styles I have seen. Many of the "best practices" between these styles also seem to contradict and it is important to understand what the reasons are for the differences to make good decisions unless your pond fits into one of the existing molds (which mine does not). 

## Koi Ponds
* Optimized for pond volume and filtration
* Steep tall walls, deep pond, few if any planting shelves, often using concrete (walls or collar) to prevent wall collapse
* No loose rocks on the bottom
* Use a bottom drain + some form of mechanical filtration often a seive and/or settling tank like swirl, radial flow etc
* Use a skimmer for surface filtration almost exclusively
* Often external bio-filtration
* Sometimes extra complex filtration and pumps (Including UV, bead, tumblers etc)


## Ecosystem Ponds

In contrast to koi builds, there appears to be a more recent movement of what I am calling Aquascape ponds (largely fulled by the company making many of the components for these ponds, though not the only group doing so). These ponds seem to have quite a different style on builds:

* Tiered shelf design with planting pockets, usually multiple smaller walls (thus less volume), using natural dirt under liner (not concrete) + rocks above liner
* Usually put loose rocks on the bottom and cover liner so not visible
* Rarely a bottom drain or any pumps on the bottom
* A skimmer (Or intake bay which I like the concept of) for surface filtration
* A waterfall of some kind for aeration + upflow bio-filtration


# Aspects of Pond Design

## Mehanical surface filtration

My choice: Intake bay

The most common option by far is installing skimmer box and is on most pond builds I have seen.

Options include:

* Skimmer box (most common in all designs)
	+ Well known + tested
	+ Usually easy to hide by placing under/near viewing area also makes maintainence more accessible
	+ Good support for water level maintainence with hidden auto-water level topup using float valve + overflow / drain
	- Needs manual maintainence maybe weekly?
	- Can suck in small animals and kill them (not great for ecosystem ponds with frogs, turtles etc)
	
* Intake bay (Seen only a few of these)
	+ Look amazing, they looks very natural
	+ Regular maintainence (maybe weekly) uses a rake to take out debri instead of pulling out baskets (Yearly maybe cleaning out rocks?)
	- Not seen a lot on these, I like the concept, do they work well I dont see much information on these after installed?
	? Are they as effective as skimmer boxes? I assume the water flow is the same but no flapper so velocity of water lower
	? Can probably install same water level maintainence in pump vault with hidden auto-water level topup using float valve + overflow / drain
	
* Lid over pond (for Aquaponics)
	In aquaponics usually they just cover the pond with a lid to prevent external debri getting in the first place. Not feasible in most ponds.
	
* Manual netting and rely on bottom drain (for people with nothing better to do)

## Mechanical bottom filtration

## Biological filtration

## Other filtration
* Bead filters, tumblers etc
* UV sterilization (not really filtration)
* Under gravel suction grids
* Bog filters
Really good info on pond filters: https://www.koiphen.com/forums/showthread.php?93019-Filtration-Basics

## Oxygenation

## Current flow


## Redundancy and safety

Including skimmers vs pump on bottom vs aquaponics style much safer gravity fed etc



## Pond shape

My choice: Natural almost kidney bean shape

This decision is more about asthetics, but some thought needs to be put into current flow and ensuring no stagnant areas of the pond

Options:

* Circle
	+ Easiest to understand current flow, helping to keep it clean and reduce maintainence
	* Not great for a natural look, is good for formal look

* Sharp corners (like a square)
	+ Difficult to ensure current flow in corners and thus keeping them clean
	* Not great for a natural look, is good for formal look

* Natural other shape (Kidney bean common)
	+ No sharp corners to prevent water flow
	- Still more difficult to understand water flow than circle
	* Great for more natural looking ponds

## Pond location/positioning

Honestly this is what I am having the most difficulty deciding on. It is something I cant afford to get wrong and has so many considerations.

My choice: Not sure?? IMPORTANT cant change afterwards!

Key points here that I have been considering:
* Ideally visible from common living areas (especially waterfall and plants)
* Approachable for feeding fish
* Avoid debri from nearby trees
	Was planning shade provded by nearby trees (deciduous, everyone advises against it)
	Now considering a shade sail and more careful planting near pond
* Many trees/plants are poisoness for fish
* If not highly elevated in landscape, consider water runoff in large rain downpours to prevent runoff entering pond
? Sun vs shade
	Ecosystem ponds all tend to want full sun for plant growth
	Koi ponds and Aquaponics all tend to want to limit sun exposure for the pond itself to limit algae growth and prevent fish getting sunburn :-)
		But then plants suffer
	Aquaponics covers the pond for full shade and then places growbeds externally in the sun
	Can we have a pond where there are some shallow planting areas in sun but deep are in shade?
	Shade tolerant aquatic plants: 
	Can we design so that sun hits aquatic plants and NOT the water?

## Pond bottom contour
Tiered vs deep 


wall slope (not straight)
https://www.gardenpondforum.com/threads/do-pond-walls-need-reinforcing.20670/
I am assuming that you are referring to the use of just liner. In that case, i wold not recommend that any wall of any height be vertical. An angle of 15 - 20 degrees from the vertical will offer satisfactory protection from any structural collapse
I would like to clarify and expand on this previous post of mine.
This angle of slope will suffice providing pond depth does not exceed 4 feet. As depth increases this angle should also increase. OSHA stipulates that for depths up to 8 feet this angle should be at least 30 degrees from vertical.
These aforementioned angles also assume that this excavation is in fairly compacted and undisturbed soil. All other soils will likely require a larger angle.

## Safety

It is important that the design considers safety of children and also animals (You dont want an animal getting stuck and drowned in your pond).  A typical ecosystem pond is usually designed with various levels of shallow shelves giving a gradual change to depth than say a typical Koi pond. 

Additionally lining the bottom with rocks also makes it easier to purchase and get back out of the pond if an accident does happen than a bare exposed slippery liner. 

Nothing is child proof, but this needs to be considered. 


There are things you can do with pond positioning, edge treatment and planting choices to help make it a little safer. Having the main approaches to the pond be shallow with a rocked in bottom is probably a key item to consider here along with planting higher barriers in areas it would be less safe to approach from.


## Underlay + Concrete:

Prevent rodents burying in liner use concrete" https://www.houzz.com.au/magazine/build-a-backyard-fish-pond-without-going-belly-up-stsetivw-vs~91523708
Expert tip: If you do go with a rubber liner, Leidner recommends buying a few bags of concrete, poking holes in them and using the bags to line the hole. Then spray the bags with water and put the rubber liner on top. The bag will dissolve and the concrete will harden, creating a barrier that rodents can’t get through.


## Hydrostatic pressure

## Overflow

## Topup

## Rocks on bottom or not

Most ecosystem ponds have rocks on the bottom they look great and it is beneficial for smaller fish, insects and other aquatic animals like frogs. Most koi ponds have bare liner all the way and are deep from the start as the koi produce huge amounts of waste and this prevents the yearly maintantence of emptying the pond by maintaining cleaner water all the time. 

Using the pond for aquaponics we would probably be mor elike a koi pond, however I want to try and acheive the best of both worlds. 

The rocks + planting pockets make the ecosystem pond more suitable for other aquatic creatures, insects and small fish, and also serve as a way for trapped animals to escape if necessary. I am actually considering rocked bottom + planting pockets in the shallows and bare exposed liner + erated bottom drain for the deeper shelves. 

My idea of using the pond for aquaponics means it is much more like a koi pond and the regular evacuation of fish waste is important. This will permit me the ability to not have to drain the pond every year I think to clean out the sludge forming under the rocks. We will see though. if all else fails I will then just do big rocks (not small) in the shallows with planted pots. But I think this isnt as good for other creatures.

I have also considered adding under-gravel suction grid for the shallows to help. The goal would be every day to reverse this to ensure no detritus is lodged inbetween the rocks and flush it out. Not sure if this will work. I know if you dont do it regulary you should never do it as it will cause real issues dislodging the waste but doing it each day might be helpful and cause it to flush to the bottom drain.

However I also want it to be suitable for frogs, for small fish, insects and other aquatic creatures. To achieve this I need planting and gradual slopes near the edges with protected coves. For frogs my understanding is they want basically still shallow warm water with planted cover. So I may have a section like that which is effectively separated off from the rest of the pond with no real current flow to it. More detail later.

My thinking is the larger fish will not spend much time in the shallows and it will accumulate very little waste as a result.

# History

Throughout the process I have worked on a few different pond designs based on where they were situated. This page documents prior stages in the pond design so I can keep a record of major changes.

This page is largely for my benefit and is probably of little use for others.
