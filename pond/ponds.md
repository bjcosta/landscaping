# Pond Design

TODO: This page is very much a work in progress. I am just outlining things at the moment and have a lot of filling in to do


Designing and building a pond is a huge amount of work compared to other parts of a backyard transformation. I have now watched hundreds of tutorials, examples and read numerous blocks of information about building and designing ponds and still dont feel I know enough. I will try and keep here a ordered reference of information I have looked at and summarize what I see are the major aspects of pond design that I have considered.

Over time I expect I will add many different sub-pages to this document.

## Overview of pond styles

There are a few major pond building styles I have seen. Many of the "best practices" between these styles also seem to contradict and it is important to understand what the reasons are and why to make good decisions unless you pond fits into one of the existing molds (which mine does not). 

### Koi Ponds
* Steep tall walls, deep pond, few if any planting shelves, often using concrete to prevent wall collapse
* No loose rocks on the bottom
* Use a bottom drain + some form of mechanical filtration often a seive
* Use a skimmer for surface filtration
* Often external bio-filtration
* Sometimes more complex filtration and extra pumps (Including UV, bead, tumblers etc)


### Ecosystem Ponds

In contrast to koi builds, there appears to be a more recent movement of what I am calling Aquascape ponds (largely fulled by the company making many of the components for these ponds, though not the only group doing so). These ponds seem to have quite a different style on builds:

* Tiered shelf design with planting pockets, usually multiple smaller walls (thus less volume), using natural dirt under liner (not concrete) + rocks above liner
* Usually put loose rocks on the bottom and cover liner so not visible
* Rarely a bottom drain or any pumps on the bottom
* A skimmer (Or intake bay which I like the concept of) for surface filtration
* A waterfall of some kind for aeration + upflow bio-filtration


# Aspects of Pond Design

## Mehanical surface filtration

My choice: Intake bay

The most common option by far is installing skimmer box and is on most pond builds I have seen.

Options include:

* Skimmer box (most common in all designs)
	+ Well known + tested
	+ Usually easy to hide by placing under/near viewing area also makes maintainence more accessible
	+ Good support for water level maintainence with hidden auto-water level topup using float valve + overflow / drain
	- Needs manual maintainence maybe weekly?
	- Can suck in small animals and kill them (not great for ecosystem ponds with frogs, turtles etc)
	
* Intake bay (Seen only a few of these)
	+ Look amazing, they looks very natural
	+ Regular maintainence (maybe weekly) uses a rake to take out debri instead of pulling out baskets (Yearly maybe cleaning out rocks?)
	- Not seen a lot on these, I like the concept, do they work well I dont see much information on these after installed?
	? Are they as effective as skimmer boxes? I assume the water flow is the same but no flapper so velocity of water lower
	? Can probably install same water level maintainence in pump vault with hidden auto-water level topup using float valve + overflow / drain
	
* Lid over pond (for Aquaponics)
	In aquaponics usually they just cover the pond with a lid to prevent external debri getting in the first place. Not feasible in most ponds.
	
* Manual netting and rely on bottom drain (for people with nothing better to do)

## Mechanical bottom filtration

## Biological filtration

## Other filtration
* Bead filters, tumblers etc
* UV sterilization (not really filtration)
* Under gravel suction grids
* Bog filters

## Oxygenation

## Current flow


## Redundancy and safety

Including skimmers vs pump on bottom vs aquaponics style much safer gravity fed etc



## Pond shape

My choice: Natural almost kidney bean shape

This decision is more about asthetics, but some thought needs to be put into current flow and ensuring no stagnant areas of the pond

Options:

* Circle
	+ Easiest to understand current flow, helping to keep it clean and reduce maintainence
	* Not great for a natural look, is good for formal look

* Sharp corners (like a square)
	+ Difficult to ensure current flow in corners and thus keeping them clean
	* Not great for a natural look, is good for formal look

* Natural other shape (Kidney bean common)
	+ No sharp corners to prevent water flow
	- Still more difficult to understand water flow than circle
	* Great for more natural looking ponds

## Pond location/positioning

Honestly this is what I am having the most difficulty deciding on. It is something I cant afford to get wrong and has so many considerations.

My choice: Not sure?? IMPORTANT cant change afterwards!

Key points here that I have been considering:
* Ideally visible from common living areas (especially waterfall and plants)
* Approachable for feeding fish
* Avoid debri from nearby trees
	Was planning shade provded by nearby trees (deciduous, everyone advises against it)
	Now considering a shade sail and more careful planting near pond
* Many trees/plants are poisoness for fish
* If not highly elevated in landscape, consider water runoff in large rain downpours to prevent runoff entering pond
? Sun vs shade
	Ecosystem ponds all tend to want full sun for plant growth
	Koi ponds and Aquaponics all tend to want to limit sun exposure for the pond itself to limit algae growth and prevent fish getting sunburn :-)
		But then plants suffer
	Aquaponics covers the pond for full shade and then places growbeds externally in the sun
	Can we have a pond where there are some shallow planting areas in sun but deep are in shade?
	Shade tolerant aquatic plants: 
	Can we design so that sun hits aquatic plants and NOT the water?

## Pond bottom contour
Tiered vs deep 


wall slope (not straight)
https://www.gardenpondforum.com/threads/do-pond-walls-need-reinforcing.20670/
I am assuming that you are referring to the use of just liner. In that case, i wold not recommend that any wall of any height be vertical. An angle of 15 - 20 degrees from the vertical will offer satisfactory protection from any structural collapse
I would like to clarify and expand on this previous post of mine.
This angle of slope will suffice providing pond depth does not exceed 4 feet. As depth increases this angle should also increase. OSHA stipulates that for depths up to 8 feet this angle should be at least 30 degrees from vertical.
These aforementioned angles also assume that this excavation is in fairly compacted and undisturbed soil. All other soils will likely require a larger angle.



## Underlay + Concrete:

Prevent rodents burying in liner use concrete" https://www.houzz.com.au/magazine/build-a-backyard-fish-pond-without-going-belly-up-stsetivw-vs~91523708
Expert tip: If you do go with a rubber liner, Leidner recommends buying a few bags of concrete, poking holes in them and using the bags to line the hole. Then spray the bags with water and put the rubber liner on top. The bag will dissolve and the concrete will harden, creating a barrier that rodents canâ€™t get through.


## Hydrostatic pressure

## Overflow

## Topup

## Rock choice
Rock types, and toxicisity and suitability

## Planting
Planting pockets, types of plans and shelf depth etc

## Fish selection

## Maintainence

## Pump location

* Pump in skimmer box
	This is the Aquascape way. They typically have a skimmer and nothing ese.

* External pump bottom of pond
	This seems uncommon these days. 

* Underwater pumps
	?Efficiency?

* External pumps?
	?Efficiency?
	?Maintainence?


# History

Throughout the process I have worked on a few different pond designs based on where they were situated. This page documents prior stages in the pond design so I can keep a record of major changes.

This page is largely for my benefit and is probably of little use for others.
