# Plant Selection and Positioning

TODO: This is very rough and just laying out my unorganized thoughts at the moment still need to see if a useful structure appears.

I have a lot more info elsewhere i need to bring into this page. I plan to get the possible specicies list sorted, then for each zone/required location specify explicit requirements (now just general requirements) and look at idea candidates and document what and why.

## Requirements

* No deciduous trees near southern neigbouring property
* No trees that are poisonous to fish within the proximity of the pond (prunus family, and others)
* Max height of tree must not cause un-accounted for shading in the design (or tree should be feasible to prune and keep at the expected height)
* Roots of trees near pool must not impact on its retaining wall and cause failure

## Goals

* Each plant added should serve more than one purpose, and one of those should always be something we typically eat
* Preferrably good for our hardiness zone
* Avoid shading of neighbouring southern property (some is ok, but not a lot)
* Avoid deciduous near pond and pool (likely not going to be possible)
* Design so colour exists through most if not all the year (Ideally flowers or colourful leaves at different times of the year)
* Avoid overhang of trees on any boundary fence
* Roots of trees near highest point (south-eastern) of new small retaining wall should not impact it causing failure (not a requirement like the pool retaining wall as I can easily repair it myself)
* Use tall trees like bananas to block view on eastern boundary fence into our backyard

## Local environment

* Frosts: Never observed (Nearby Albion park apparently 1.1 days mean a year, we maybe more protected)
* Chill hours: 400-500 (Medium)
* Soil PH: 5.1  : Acidic, need to improve using Calcitic lime (calcium carbonate), not dolomitic lime as high sodium content
* Soil type: Clay, bad drainage (will attempt to improve using lime and adding organic matter)
* Soil notes: Quite high salinity (Sodium, need to increase calcium)
* Sun: 80-100%(Full)
* Wind: Windy gusts in August and Feburary
* Rainfall: 893mm per year, most in feb/mar fairly even through rest of year lowest month is sep
* Slope aspect: Northerly
* Hardiness Zone: 10b (1.7 - 4.4 degrees Celcius) (Or an aus specific zone 4 : https://www.anbg.gov.au/gardens/research/hort.research/zones.html)

## Designed in micro-climates

TODO: Very similar to the zones below. Maybe also consider the swales and water retention and chickens nutrient runoff



## Considered Species List

TODO: Earlier on I had a list of considered specicies I had details like below. I think having this would help me decide what to include/not

TODO Tidy up this list and order, use data from mango example to inform what it might look like
Maybe make it parsable so I can easily match to my requirements

* pH range: 
* Light requirements: 
* Soil type
* Temperature requirements (and hardiness zone)
* Max height
* Shape
* Density
* Category: Tree, shrub, ground cover, vine
* Typical pests/diseases
* Overall Hardiness for area
* Notes:
* Ideally add info about fruiting/flowering times and colours so can evaluate asthetics
* Water reuqirements
* Also tried to kee list of maintainence requirements so I can see what needs to be done through the year

### Mango 
* Best variety selected: R2E2 Mango (Mangifera indica)
* Frosts: Sometimes : https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/mango-r2e2-grafted-tree.htm

* Chill hours: N/A
* Sun location: Full (Sun:80%-100%) : https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/mango-r2e2-grafted-tree.htm
* Soil type: Good Drainage : https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/mango-r2e2-grafted-tree.htm
* Water requirements: Moderate : https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/mango-r2e2-grafted-tree.htm
	* Withhold water for the three months prior to flowering, to encourage flowers, then water evenly until fruit ripens.
* Height: 5-10m : https://www.daleysfruit.com.au/buy/mango-r2e2-grafted-tree.htm
* Width: 5m : https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/business-priorities/plants/fruit-and-vegetables/fruit-and-nuts/mangoes/mango-varieties/r2e2
* Why I chose that variety: 
	* Ok in cooler climates NSW (https://www.gardenclinic.com.au/how-to-grow-article/mangoes)
	* Hardy/vigorous tree
	* Good fruit
* Requirements for choice:
	* Evergreen not shedding leaves into neighbors pool or pond
	* Tree to provide canopy shade
	* I have seen some in our area they have almost mushroom shape I want for the tree
* How/When to plant it:
	* Best in Autumn apparently : https://www.gardenclinic.com.au/how-to-grow-article/mangoes
	* All cases read indicate dig big hole put manure in the bottom of it
* How/When to prune:
	* Very good description and reasoning of pruning:
	https://dpir.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/232920/598.pdf
* How/When to fertilize:
	* Organic best suceptible to burn
	* Similar to cirtus
	* Do not fertilise after midsummer
	* Young trees are particularly sensitive to over-fertilising, but respond well to seaweed and fish emulsion
* What/When to spray:
	* Very susceptible to anthracnose and other fungal problems
	* Regularly spray anti-fungal alternate Mancozeb and copper oxychloride spray: during flowering then monthly until harvest : https://www.gardenclinic.com.au/how-to-grow-article/mangoes
* RTL Model: Using "Cashew Tree" is too wide for height.
* Useful information:
	* Most useful calendar of things to do and when it grows etc: http://era.daf.qld.gov.au/id/eprint/1647/8/HG-1mango.pdf
	* Very reliable and detailed commercial info for mangos and growing: https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/business-priorities/plants/fruit-and-vegetables/fruit-and-nuts/mangoes

## Key locations with specific requirements

There are a few key locations that have specific requirements, these are mostly trees and is why I needed to wait until design before selection.

* 1x Large canopy evergreen tree
  We have planned for a single larger canopy evergreen tree. This is still not a huge tree but can grow a bit larger as it is not directly on the south boundary fence but planted a bit further into the yard and expected to provide shade in the south-western corner year-round.
  
  Considered species:
  * Mango (R2E2 best variety for area after research) TODO add references
  * Maccadamia
  * Avacado
  
  This has already been chosen as a R2E2 Mango tree, it has been planted and is doing well. I saw multiple mango trees in the area thriving and producing fruit.
  Purposes:
  * Food (Highly rated we will always eat this if it fruits)
  * Shade / structure
  * Asthetics : Also considered a macadamia tree here, but macadamia trees do not look as good)

* 1x Large canopy deciduous tree (Near pool, must drop leaves in winter to provide sunlight to others)
  We have space allocated for a single large deciduous tree. From my calculations this tree can afford to be upto 6m high easily without an impact on shading for the pond and other areas of the garden. it may be able to be a bit larger
  
  Considered species:
  * Apple
  * Pear
  * Cherry (Looks lovely, but likely too close to pond and species prunus is toxic for fish)
  * Almond
  * TODO Other nut trees might be suitable as well

  Issues to consider:
  * Root system and pool retaining wall
  * Proximity to pond and toxicity for fish
  * Shape and proximity of branches to pool fence (for pool safety, there are regulations, but probably far enough away)

* 3-5x Smaller/Medium evergreen tree(s) (Along southern boundary fence, dont overhang, dont overshade south, provide canopy)
  * We have space for a number of smaller evergreen trees on the southern boundary fence. 
  
  Considered species:
  * Lemon (Eureka)
  * Orange (Dwarf)

* Nx? Dense bush hiding chicken run
  Ideally evergreen but not a requirement. It should be dense and height is unimportant. Will have partial sun (probably more than 50%)
  The main purpose of this is to hide the chicken run and the fence behind it. 
  
  There can be multiple here there is space and the more dense it is the better.
  
  Considered species:
  * Coffee (Not particulary dense but ok)
  ?

* Tall narrow trees for blocking eastern view into our back yard

  Want about 4-6m high
  
  Considered species:
  * Banana
  * Palm trees
  
  Issues to consider:
  * Is inside chook run and so must be narrow at base

* Smaller deciduous near glass house / pool fence. There is space for something like a fig here I think



## Planting Zones

In addition to the above specific locations, I have a few zones in which I expect to be able to plant a variety of smaller shrubs/ground covers that are not as specific for purposes as the ones above. Instead these have the luxury of being "fillers" and so can serve purposes other than shade/structure, hiding things etc.

These can add colour/asthetics, or more likely be herbs or small berry bushes. I dont mind a few of these being exotic as they dont take lots of space. 

The goal is to layer the planting so get the most out of all the space.

* Aquaponic growbed (Annuals / Vegies)
* Raised garden bed (Annuals / Vegies)
  * We will not place annuals in the main garden, instead we plan to have 2x raised beds close to the kitchen window we can use to grow annuals
  * Additionally the aquaponics system will largely be fore leafy greens and other fast growing annuals that are good at taking nutrients from the pond
  * Has decent sunlight, just not in the morning

* Raised garden bed mostly shaded in winter
  * Near the BBQ area, this is temporary and may be replaced one day with a decking area.
  * Been successful growing sweet potatoes and pumpkin in here, but in winter not much sun at all

* Full shade
  * There is a little space near the chicken coop for any plants that can grow ok in full shade. Not a lot of these, we are looking for hrubs, vines, and ground covers

* Partial shade
  * Especially on the southern fence, there is space for numerous shrubs, vines and ground covers that will have partial shade. More shade in summer and less in winter

* Sunny shrubs / ground covers
  * On the boundary of the souther fence, there is space for a few shrubs and multiple ground coverings in full sun

* Full sun climber
  * Over the arbor / trellis at the entrance to the walkway, we have space for one climber (maybe two one on each side). I am considering grapes here.
  * They will have access to nearly full sun climbing up the arbor.

* Aquatic plants
  * Some needed for providing shade to fish (Lillies for example)
  * Maybe some are edible? What can we do here with edible planting? 
  * Some specifically for the frog area
  * Take into account height, asthetics etc
