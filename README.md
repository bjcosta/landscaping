# Asthectically pleasing, productive backyard landscaping

This project will be used as a place to document my learnings and decisions made for a landscaping project in my backyard.

If others are interested in designing an asthectically pleasing yet productive landscape in their suburban back yards, then maybe they can learn from my mistakes.

Overall we are trying to achieve a few things in this design:
* Asthetically pleasing (Most permaculture, aquaponic systems I see are ugly, with a bit of planning I think there is no need for them to be)
* Efficient/Sustainable (Setting up as many natural cycles as possible, working with nature instead of against it)
* Productive (Fruit, vegetables, eggs, fish)
* Reduced maintainence (through automation and good up-front design)

## Goal statement

I used this as guide to create the goal statement: https://www.milkwood.net/2015/10/26/permaculture-design-process-1-writing-a-goal-statement/

The purpose of the goal statement is to help us imagine what it is like and ensure that decisions I make along the way contribute to the high level outcome instead of getting lost in the details of specific technologies (I cant help myself though I MUST have a pond).

Our small suburban back yard is a is productive and beautiful ecosystem. With a focus on sustainable closed loop ecosystems, it provides us with some edible food and a habitat for local wildlife.

Providing shade in the summer, it is a perfect space to entertain a few guests in a calming and peaceful environment.


# Key technologies

I will document a few of the key technologies I plan to use in this design and why I wanted to add them.

## Fowl

Using fowl as part of the suburban eco-system is hugely beneficial. They perform multiple different duties that help in the recycling of waste and health of the overall garden.

Most likely we will include some bantham chickens, however if we are unable to do that due to various constraints, I will consider using spotted pheasants or other form of fowl. They are good at:
* Recycling human waste converting to manure good for the garden
* Cleaning bugs from lower storey plants
* Scratching around and aerating the soil
* Providing meat and eggs

## Poly-culture/Diversity

We plan to plant various different species and types of plants. This includes flowers, fruit, vegetables and other possily non-edible support plants that help define the eco-system. 

TODO Many more details

Admittedly we will have a bias towards plants for human production which may cause us some issues, however I will adjust this as necessary after trying it out.


## Ecosystem pond

Adding running water into an ecosystem can introduce a huge diversity of wildlife to your back yard. This include birds, insects, frogs and lizzards. 

A diverse ecosystem is often naturally more robust, helping to improve its stability as there are fewer cases of individual parts of it going unchecked caused by missing predators.

Additionally, having a body of water in the back-yard will affect the micro-climate. Adding humidity and a bit more thermal stability. Especially if it is enclosed by structure such as trees/shrubs to hold the humidity in a little.

Some issues with adding a pond might be unwanted guests like mosquitos, however if the pond is stocked correctly by say adding rainbowfish (again not a mono-culture of fish) we can minimise the impact of this. 

The goal with the pond stocking will be to again have diversity. By choosing species carefully I believe we can have diversity + productivity. My initial goal here is to consider stocking native fish that each have a purpose:
* Silver perch for eating
* Eel tailed catfish for eating and stirring up the bottom to help clean the pond
* Some form of rainbowfish (or other suitable species) for preying on mosquitos
* Maybe some alae eating species like galss shrimp

I know that some of these may eat each other, however if we design it correctly by including sufficient aquatic plants, rock formations and shallow sections we may be able to minimise this impact.

The biggest issue with a pond is its complexity and potentially power usage. Designing to include it is taking more time than the rest of the garden. Hopefully with the right design, the maintainence can be minimised. 

I expect to use a small 45W pump to run it 24/7, but automate a larger pump during the day when the solar panels are generating excess power to permit suficient water flow for the filtering. Additionally the pump is a critical part of the system and we should account for redundancy by having two pumps installed (or a backup aerator) and a backup battery with automatic failover.

## Insect larvae

One of the more common used for this is Black soldier fly larvae. I have also seen someone in Melbourne using native flies which maybe preferrable for the climate we have.

The idea is that larvae are very efficient at converting edible waste into protien and fat. The larvae themselves are good food for the chickens and fish.

With black soldier fly larvae, apparently when they are getting ready to pupate they will crawl upwards, so a ramp can be made in the holding container and they will automatically crawl up when big enough and drop into say a bucket which we can then use.

The other thing about these flies is that they do not bother people too much and will return to the same container to lay eggs.

Issues we need to overcome are:
* Smell
* Are native flies suitable for this
* Which scraps to feed the larvae and which to feed the chickens

## Composting

TODO


## Water retention
TODO Passive water retention using swales, berms, mulch and shade
Water tanks, positioning usage


## Symbiotic mycelium
TODO Layer wood mulch on top of soil and innocuate with edible mushroom mycelium

## Aquaponics

This is something I am super interested in. I will plan to try it in my garden and if it fails that is ok. 
TODO

### Red wriggler worms

TODO lots of individual ideas/technologies in the aquaponics section

One goal is to try and automate as much as possible to reduce maintainence, this includes:
* Water/irrigation



# Observations

## Soil

## Sunlight

## Drainage and water flow

## Walking Paths

## Other

* South boundry fence not stable, soil moves 
* Neighboring property on west has unobstructed view into our back yard, extended balcony
* Neighboring property on south is very tidy and has a pool, will avoid overhanging deciduous trees on boundary
* Pee-wees, bower birds, willy wagtails frequent yard gathering food and insects from ope compost bins


# Process



# Inspirations

Many things have provided inspiration in this design. Two areas in particular though stand out; Permaculture and Aquaponics.


# Old Designs

This is a list of previous designs I made to a fairly stable point and then decided to change something significant. It gives a reasonable idea of the process tha has happened over the last few years:
