# Asthectically pleasing, productive landscaping

This project will be used as a place to document my learnings and decisions made for a landscaping project in my backyard.

If others are interested in designing an asthectically pleasing yet productive landscape in their suburban back yards, then maybe they can learn from my mistakes.

## Goal statement

I used this as guide to create the goal statement: https://www.milkwood.net/2015/10/26/permaculture-design-process-1-writing-a-goal-statement/

The purpose of the goal statement is to ensure that decisions I make along the way contribute to the high level outcome instead of getting lost in the details.

Our small suburban back yard is a is productive and beautiful ecosystem. With a focus on sustainable closed loop ecosystems, it provides us with some edible food and a habitat for local wildlife.

Providing shade in the summer, it is a perfect space to entertain a few guests in a calming and peaceful environment.


# Inspiration

Many things have provided inspiration in this design. Two areas in particular though stand out; Permaculture and Aquaponics.



# Old Designs

This is a list of previous designs I made to a fairly stable point and then decided to change something significant. It gives a reasonable idea of the process tha has happened over the last few years:
