# Staged Garden Construction Plan

Here I will outline the staged plan I have for implementing various aspects of my landscaping project and why I expect to do things in this order.

There are some items I consider foundational to the garden that must be done early on and are large tasks on which many other items depend. It is not easy to "start small" for these things which kind-of goes against [Permaculture principle 9 Use small and slow solutions](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture#Twelve_design_principles>). I do like this principle in theory except for foundational work and up-front design in which I feel having these setup well in the first place will make a significant difference.

My approach is upfront design and foundational work as a big chunk at the start (with the understanding that some things in the initial design will not work out as expected), followed by the iterative small and slow change technique for everything else following it in way that fits within the foundation I have setup.
